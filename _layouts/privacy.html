      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

      <p class="medium justify">
        This Privacy Policy describes how your Personal Information is
        collected, used, and shared by Raiden Trust. Personal
        Information means any information relating to an identified or
        identifiable natural person, who may be identified, directly or
        indirectly by reference to an identifier such as a name, an
        identification number, location data, online information (e.g. an IP
        address) or to one or more factors relating to that person. This notice
        applies to Personal Information provided to us by visitors to
        <a href="https://www.raidentrust.li/" target="_blank"
          >https://www.raidentrust.li/</a
        >
        (the “Site”), end users, beta testers, suppliers, contractors, job
        applicants, customers or other direct or indirect users or recipients of
        the services we carry out and functions we perform in running the Site.
        In this notice “you” refers to any individual whose Personal Information
        we hold or process.

        PERSONAL DATA
      </h2>

        Personal Information we hold about you will be processed either because:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li class="justify">
          the processing is necessary in pursuit of a “legitimate interest”; a
          legitimate interest in this context means a valid interest we have or
          a third party has in processing your personal data which is not
          overridden by your interests in data privacy and security;
        </li>
        <li class="justify">
          you have consented to the processing for the specific purposes
          described in this notice; or

      <h2>
        <span class="first-line-span">.</span>2. PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT
      </h2>

      <p class="medium justify">
        When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information
        about you and your device, including information about your web browser,
        IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on
        your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect
        information about the individual web pages or products that you view,
        what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information
        about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this
        automatically-collected information as “Device Information.” We collect
        Device Information using the following technologies:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li class="justify">
          “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer

        </li>
        <li class="justify">
          “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data
          including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider,
          referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.
        </li>

      <p class="medium justify">
        Additionally, when you sign up for a newsletter through the Site, we
        collect your email address and may collect additional contact details
        such as your address and phone number. We refer to this information as
        “Subscription Information.” In the course of our interactions, we may
        also collect a record and details of any correspondence or
        communications between you and us or relating to any job application,
        information request or job application submitted to us. We refer to this
        information as “Communication Information”. When we talk about “Personal
        Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device
        Information, Subscription Information and Communication Information.

        OUTSIDE EUROPE
      </h2>

      <p class="medium justify">
        We will not transfer any data in a systematic way outside of the EEA but
        there may be circumstances in which certain personal information is
        transferred outside of the EEA, in particular:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li class="justify">
          if you live outside of the EEA, we may communicate with you during the
          course of our interactions and such communications may include
          Personal Information (such as Subscription Information);
        </li>
        <li class="justify">
          we may have certain third-party service suppliers who are based
          outside the EEA or who store data outside of the EEA;

      <p class="medium justify">
        If we transfer your information outside of the EEA in a systematic way,

        been deemed by the EU Commission to have adequate data protection laws,
        we will provide appropriate safeguards and your privacy rights will
        continue to be enforceable against us as outlined in this notice.

      <h2><span class="first-line-span">.</span>7. YOUR RIGHTS</h2>

      </p>

      <h2><span class="first-line-span">.</span>8. DATA RETENTION</h2>

      <p class="medium justify">
        When you sign up for a newsletter through the Site or we acquire your
        Personal Information due to another interaction with the Raiden Trust, we will
        generally maintain your Personal Information in our records for twelve
        months unless you ask us to delete this information before such time has
        passed. We may retain your Personal Information for more than twelve
        months if we consider it is necessary to enable us to satisfactorily
        provide the information on the Site or administer the Site or to enable
        us to comply with any statutory, legal or contractual obligation we may
        have. We review the Personal Information (and the categories of personal
        data) we are holding on a regular basis to ensure the data we are
        holding is still accurate and is still relevant to the Raiden trust and its Site. If
        we discover that certain data we are holding is no longer necessary or
        accurate, we will take reasonable steps to correct or delete this data
        as may be required.
      </p>

      <h2><span class="first-line-span">.</span>9. SECURITY</h2>

      <p class="medium justify">
        We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that appropriate technical
        and organisational measures are carried out in order to safeguard your
        Personal Information and protect against unlawful access and accidental
        loss or damage. These measures may include (as necessary):
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>compliance with our internal IT security procedures;</li>
        <li>protecting our servers by both hardware and software firewalls;</li>
        <li>
          locating our data processing storage facilities in secure locations;

        </li>
        <li>
          when necessary, disposing of or deleting your data in a secure manner;
          and
        </li>
        <li>regularly backing up and encrypting all data we hold.</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="medium justify">
        We will ensure that all contractors, staff or individuals engaged by us
        are aware of their privacy and data security obligations. We will take
        reasonable steps to ensure that the employees of third parties working
        on our behalf or providing services to us are aware of their privacy and
        data security obligations. Unfortunately, the transmission of
        information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will
        do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the
        security of your data transmitted by you to us by email. Once we have
        received your information, we will use the procedures and security
        features referred to in this Privacy Policy to try to prevent
        unauthorised access.
